    <p class ="one"> India is a country with many different cultures and religions.It is the only country in the world that refuses to 
        accept the slogan "Unity in Diversty"
        In comparison to the rest of the world,India has more festivals.some of these festivals celerbrate the arrival of the seasons,harvest
        ,rains,and even full moon ,while others celebrate religious events such as Gods'birthdays or the start of the local new year.
        The majority if indian festivals are observed throughout the country, but some are known by different names in different parts of the 
        country. 
        India remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world.
         Apart from its many religions and sects, India is home to innumerable castes and tribes, as well as to more than a dozen major and hundreds of minor linguistic groups from several language families unrelated to one another. Religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains, still account for a significant proportion of the population; collectively, 
        their numbers exceed the populations of all countries except China.
